    "Climate change is having a severe impact on coastal cities worldwide, causing rising sea levels, stronger storms, and flooding that threaten both infrastructure and communities. For example, Miami, Florida, has experienced frequent \"sunny day flooding,\" where high tides, not storms, cause streets to flood. This is a direct result of rising sea levels, pushing saltwater into the city's streets and making it harder for residents to go about their daily lives. Additionally, the increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes, fueled by warmer ocean temperatures, endanger millions of people living near coastlines. Coastal cities are now facing the urgent need for climate adaptation strategies, like building sea walls or moving communities inland. However, these measures are expensive and often controversial. The reality is, if we don’t take swift action, many coastal cities may soon be uninhabitable, disrupting economies and displacing countless people."
